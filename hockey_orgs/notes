Okay it works but it's gotta get cleaned up big time

Instantiate a class you SOB 
that's clearly what they want from you, you just got carried away 
thats fine though it works 

lol you did that quick 

need to split up some more of that bs into 
clean little functions or methods or whatever

get it going on 

alphabetized, indexed, enter a number to pick a team 
how to do that 
what is the problem 
that's a question for the morning 

filter out invalid inputs and the indexed input thing 
those are the big ones 

don't worry about making it pretty necessarily, who cares

org.rb 80 that cannot be input, i don't think
why not? 
well basically i'd like to get to the point where the list is
a list of the actual objects, the instances of Org that are generated
and are selectable based on Org.name(i did this, but Org.id instead)
it needs to be actually selecting the instance. not just providing 
input which i can use to call the instance.

new class called like grabber or something? who cares what it's called
thats what it will do. it will grab.
that way the input could be a class variable or i guess an instance variable
and even when it goes to the next method it would still grab that variable.

not sure what that shit above is about. 

it's broken, basically. something is trying to do too many things
something is showing up where it shouldn't be 
i assume it has something to do with seperation of concerns. but maybe not 

take the time tomorrow(or tonight) to draw up a flowchart. 
you absolutely can track this issue down. 

the problems right now(order of importance)
1. it's broken 
2. filter out invalid inputs 
3. clean it up, check out seperation of concerns

just needs to be done sunday night but tomorrow would be great
